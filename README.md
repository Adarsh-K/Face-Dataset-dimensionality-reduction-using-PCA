# Here I've used PCA for dimensionality reduction of Face dataset. The code is in Matlab.
Note: All the files are well documented and commented wherever I felt necessary

Run the file named FaceDatasetDRusingPCA.m which does the following:
1. Visualises the Face Dataset
2. Runs PCA and visualises the Eigenvectors which in this case are the EigenFaces
3. Now project images to the eigen space using the top k eigenvectors
4. Displays the orignal and reconstructed faces side-by-side
